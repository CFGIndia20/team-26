 To get feedback from the families to children suffering from chronic diseases like cancer, overcoming the barriers like Family background, Manipulation of feedback, Lengthy Questionnaire, Language Barrier etc and to have an automated communication with the donors, to answer their queries at any time.
 
 2. Proposed Solution
 
    The major thing feature that was reqquired was of feedbacks to build the systems which can solve the concerns that will have maxnium amount of feedback with best accuracy  using the interactive agents called chats bot and process the text to speech feature for the people who are not able to use our software that will help in overcoming the language barrier where users will be comfortable language. The tedious userInterface is now replaced with pixel perfect interfaces with greater user experience. Moving the entire system to Whatsapp that is the most commonly used app amount of feedback is overcomed.
